Loops question 3 game
Create a battle program where a goblin battles Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo has 50 HP, and the goblin
has 100HP. In each round, the user will be asked to enter attack damage between 0 and 35; this
damage will be taken off of the goblinâ€™s health. The goblin will then strike Bilbo for 10 HP. The
rounds will continue until either the Goblin or Bilbo has HP < 0. Once finished, tell the user how
many rounds the battle took.
